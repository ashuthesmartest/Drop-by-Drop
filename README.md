This is a website that was created to raise awareness about Water conservation in India. The project was initially made for the "Doors to Diplomacy" competition hosted by Global School Net sponsored by the U. S. Department of State.

The significance of this project lies in the fact that it was started by 4 teammates, but it gained such a craze in our school, that more than about 500 people both from and out of the school became top contributors for this.
