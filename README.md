This is a website that was created to raise awareness about Water conservation in India. The project was initially made for the "Doors to Diplomacy" competition hosted by Global School Net sponsored by the U. S. Department of State.

The significance of this project lies in the fact that it was started by 4 teammates, but it gained such a craze in our school, that more than about 500 people both from and out of the school became top contributors for this.

We did raise quite an awareness atleast for the nearby region and studied how the "Makora" village newar Greater Noida was almost on the verge of a terrible drought.

Although the majority of the work was done by 4 teammates, but as mentioned above the project was unthinkable without our classmates, teachers and residents of the Makora village. Also we went door to door in our localities to create awareness.

First, the project was presented in 2009 initially for Doors to Diplomacy. Although we did not receive any award, but we received great accolades from the judges, and our peer participants who were supposed to judge us too.

The same project presented in 2010 and 2011, but with different members, due to our study concerns. We had no regrets and were proud that our project was being presented. 

The project with the new team is hosted and can be viewed at http://www.drop-by-drop.weebly.com


The original team that worked on the project was

Ashutosh Agarwal (https://github.com/ashuthesmartest)

Aman Pandey

Pranav Agarwal (https://github.com/pranav-agarwal)

Rishabh Mishra

Personally, I find this project the closest to me amongst all those I have done, because it was totally a team effort and a lot was learnt and discovered about ourselves during the course of this project.
